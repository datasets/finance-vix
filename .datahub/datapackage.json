  "readme": "CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) time-series dataset including daily open, close,\nhigh and low. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a key measure of market\nexpectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option\nprices introduced in 1993.\n\n## Data\n\nFrom the [VIX FAQ][faq]:\n\n> In 1993, the Chicago Board Options ExchangeÃ‚Â® (CBOEÃ‚Â®) introduced the CBOE\n> Volatility IndexÃ‚Â®, VIXÃ‚Â®, and it quickly became the benchmark for stock market\n> volatility. It is widely followed and has been cited in hundreds of news\n> articles in the Wall Street Journal, Barron's and other leading financial\n> publications. Since volatility often signifies financial turmoil, VIX is\n> often referred to as the \"investor fear gauge\".\n>\n> VIX measures market expectation of near term volatility conveyed by stock\n> index option prices. The original VIX was constructed using the implied\n> volatilities of eight different OEX option series so that, at any given time,\n> it represented the implied volatility of a hypothetical at-the-money OEX\n> option with exactly 30 days to expiration.\n> \n> The New VIX still measures the market's expectation of 30-day volatility, but\n> in a way that conforms to the latest thinking and research among industry\n> practitioners. The New VIX is based on S&P 500 index option prices and\n> incorporates information from the volatility \"skew\" by using a wider range of\n> strike prices rather than just at-the-money series. \n\n[faq]: http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/faq.aspx\n\n## Preparation\n\nRun the shell script:\n\n    . scripts/process.sh\n\nOutput data is in `data/`.\n\n### TODO\n\n* Incorporate computed historical data (1990-2003)\n* Consider incorporating VOX data\n\n## License\n\nNo obvious statement on [historical data page][historical].
